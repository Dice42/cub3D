GETTING RGB COLORS FOR CEILING AND FLOOR:


-These will be calculated by splitting the line for color where there is a ','.
 then we check the number of elements in that "split" string, if 3. we atoi each entry.
 atoi: if value is negative, invalid. if value is greater than 255, invalid.
-Then these 3 values are stored in the "ceiling_color" and "floor_color" int arrays as {R,G,B}
-We finally free the split string.


PARSING MAP:

-first character OTHER THAN SPACE in each
